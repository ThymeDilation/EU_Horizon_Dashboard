Collaboration network:

For the collaboration network: I am not sure there is much to be gained there from pulling from a database. The filtering requires things like drop_duplicates, unique(), ... to reduce redundant collaborations from the collab_df (which highly depends on the filters so cannot be stored in a database I think)

What we can store: two DataFrames 

From self.data.project_df (usually df_proj):

'sci_voc_titles' (for field filtering)
'projectID' (for joining/filtering)
'fundingScheme' (for project_type filtering)

From self.data.organization_df (usually df_org):

'projectID' (for joining/grouping)
'name' (institution name, for nodes)
'activityType' (for org_types filtering)
'country' (for countries filtering)
'discipline' (for disciplines filtering)
'startDate' (for year filtering)
'contribution' (for contribution filtering)

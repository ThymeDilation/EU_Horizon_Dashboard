A constant goal in almost all areas of electronics is miniaturization. Miniaturization leads to a reduction in strip thicknesses and places ever higher demands on materials in terms of strength, conductivity, and formability. The trend towards transmitting higher currents goes hand in hand with higher demands on the base material. A key requirement for materials is thermal relaxation resistance, which enables it to maintain spring forces and transmit currents.Soluterials goal is to develop, produce and to offer nano-structured lightweight materials. Based on Ms. Kasakewitsch's scientific work and doctoral thesis, we developed a nanostructured aluminium material InC and transferred the production process from laboratory to pilot industrial scale. InC is the material that meets contemporary requirements and sets the course for the future.  It’s a key enabling technology that will lead to far-reaching developments in downstream industries. The material properties are needed in all future industries, such as e-mobility, 5G, and electronics. For example, electrical conductors such as high-voltage cables could be constructed as self-supporting materials in future\", ' in e-mobility, e-motors could be radically miniaturised.  InC opens up completely new possibilities for the miniaturisation of electrical components. In addition, like aluminium, InC can be produced cost-effectively on established production lines in one process step.Soluterials is a \"\"game-changer\"\" in a multipurpose metal design (our customers can streamline their production by using only one instead of several metals/alloys for their different products/applications).

         "Plasmodium vivax is considered the most difficult species of human malaria parasite to eliminate because of the inability of conventional diagnostics to detect individuals who carry dormant liver forms and sustain malaria transmission. The consortium has developed the first diagnostic test that addresses this problem. PvSeroRDT aims to develop a point-of-care (POC) rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to transfer the consortium’s validated lab-based test to the field to support implementation of the P. vivax Serological Test and Treatment (PvSeroTAT) malaria control strategy.      The PvSeroRDT specific objectives are: 1) Develop a POC RDT using lateral flow technology to measure antibodies to four P. vivax proteins that are biomarkers for the dormant liver-stage of P. vivax. 2) Establish Africa-based manufacturing capacity at DIATROPIX (Senegal) following RDT development at Abingdon Health, a UK-based SME specialising in lateral flow assays.3) Validate RDT performance with bio-banked samples, followed by field-based clinical validation on freshly collected samples in Ethiopia and Madagascar.4) Develop a clear regulatory strategy to streamline market authorization and access to this first-in-class P. vivax serological testing. PvSeroRDT addresses all expected outcomes and impacts of this call topic and work program, respectively. Specifically, it will contribute a robust POC diagnostic to the pipeline in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and enable the implementation of the AU-EU Innovation Agenda for public health. The project is designed to address the WHO’s preferred profile for P. vivax diagnosis, to translate an SME prototype to Africa-based industrial design, and to test clinical performance in several SSA sites, thus enhancing international cooperation in SSA and improving training opportunities in SSA. Ultimately, PvSeroRDT will facilitate implementation of PvSeroTAT – a new intervention for malaria elimination.",

The partnership will implement a range of activities via peer-to-peer learning, including study visits and staff exchanges, to develop closer relationships within the partnership, and with the wider regional innovation ecosystems, as well as to learn improved innovation support measures.  These will be cemented via operational work to build and develop innovation ecosystems and SMEs via hackathons and challenges (160 organisations involved),  by providing direct SME support on innovation management (24 cross-border KAM cases), and helping widening country SMEs towards financing of innovation projects (50+ cases). Over 450 SMEs will be engaged with during the implementation of the project, which will include active cooperation with 20 other innovation ecosystems. BIOBoost connects 7 homogenous EU regions in terms of similarities of RIS3 and S3 Platform synergies related to bioeconomy and digitalisation. The multidisciplinary partnership has been strategically selected, to work in  an inclusive and interactive bottom-up process, to discover potential new activities, and identify new opportunities that emerge from this interaction. Despite the homogeneity in terms of regional smart specialisation, the consortium consists of partners with a wide variety of complementary skills and experience, covering a wide geographical area and with considerable economic, social and environmental differences.",

         "Chronic inflammation underlies several diseases. In Crohns disease (CD), there is mounting evidence of a preclinical phase characterized by immunological changes that precede symptoms. Here, we propose a thorough and innovative approach to better understand the health-to-chronic inflammation transition occurring in patients with CD that will be translated in improved disease prediction and prevention. We will address how changes in glycosylation of the gut mucosa act as a primary event that dysregulates not only local mechanisms (imposing maladapted host-microbiome interactions) but also systemic mechanisms (promoting anti-microbial antibodies production), involving the novel concept of glycan mimicry as an early trigger of the health to inflammation transition  GlycanTrigger. Capitalizing on our recent findings showing that changes in the expression of complex branched N-glycans at gut mucosa regulate Inflammatory Bowel Disease immunopathogenesis, we here hypothesize that changes in gut glycocalyx impose early perturbations in host-microbiome interactions, leading to the exposure of altered (glyco)neoantigens, both by pathogens and host epithelial cells which trigger the activation of innate immune response. Moreover, following our recent discovery that changes in glycosylation can be detected in serum years before CD diagnosis and are correlated with increased levels of pathogenic antimicrobial antibodies (ASCA), we will here pursue the hypothesis that changes in mucosa glycans constitute a major source for the development of anti-glycan antibodies (ASCA), associated with health-to-inflammation transition. The long-term GOAL of this proposal is to unlock, through an integrative approach, a new checkpoint that regulates the transition to chronic inflammation. Our proposal will lead to breakthrough concepts in the health to chronic inflammation transition and to novel predictive tools translated in novel glyco-intervention strategies for disease prevention.",

As part of the FPA, a call for proposals (CfP) was launched jointly with the EU and supported the preclinical development of Rift Valley Fever Virus vaccines and the late-stage development of Chikungunya virus vaccines (CHIKV). While previous funding has led to the development of pre-licensure CHIK vaccines, in this current application we like to further advance our CHIK vaccine programme, and support CHIK vaccines that are near or have achieved regulatory licensure by supporting their clinical development into phase IV clinical trials to increase our understanding of the long-term safety, durability of protection, and effectiveness against virologically confirmed disease. Furthermore, we would like to expand the use indication by supporting clinical trials in vulnerable populations, including children, immunosuppressed and pregnant women. As part of this grant application, we also like to launch a CfP on Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIM). The overall objective of the CHIM proposal is to support research projects that increase knowledge in vaccine-induced mucosal immunity and advance the development of transmission-blocking vaccines against coronaviruses and other potential respiratory viral threats. The expected outcome of this CfP is to create a global network of experts conducting CHIM at a high level of consistency and reliability. This current grant application seeks to leverage €70M from Horizon Europe, which will be supplemented with €30M from CEPI making a pool of €100M. Awards will have a 36–48-month duration and will be administered by the CEPI secretariat.",

The founding team coThe Oater is a female-founded food tech start-up from Germany that develops a compact machine for hyper-local fresh oat milk production to reduce waste and emissions. The founding team consists of four members, led by CEO and Head of Hardware Sarah Nesti. With Lisa Nesti (CMO) and Henrik Burger (CFO) in the business team and Benjamin Auer (CTO) as the process engineer this diverse team is perfectly equipped to create a successful business. The founders gained prior start-up experience in a B2B e-commerce business launched in 2020 with over 30 customers and 30K Euro revenue. The entire team consists of 9 members, including two marketing experts, two business assistants and a product designer.The Oaters goal is to inspires sustainable consumption to protect and enrich life for all generations to come. We want to achieve this by downsizing the industrial production into a compact machine for local production of fresh oat milk. This doesn’t only improve taste, but also lowers costs and reduces the environmental impact. By producing the oat milk at the point of sale packaging is eliminated and transport emissions are significantly reduced due to the fact that oat milk is 90% water. The Oater’s business model is “Oat milk as a service” meaning that B2B customers borrow the machine for free and only pay by liter for the Oater packages, which consist of the ingredients needed to produce the oat milk in the machine. This model ensures constant delivery profits and scale-up as hardware profits are negligible compared to delivery service. The Oater provides a holistic ecosystem solution, consisting of the IoT machine, frequent replenishments, and a smart online platform. The main objectives are to introduce customers into our ecosystem, simplify entry and make oat milk exciting at the POS.",
